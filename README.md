Overview

This project is a simple AI Quiz Website built using HTML and CSS.
It allows users to test their knowledge of Artificial Intelligence with three levels of difficulty:

Basic – Covers introductory AI questions.

Medium – Slightly more challenging questions for learners.

Advanced – Tough questions to test deep AI understanding.

Each quiz page displays multiple-choice questions. When a user selects an answer:

✅ Correct answers are highlighted green

❌ Wrong answers are highlighted red

This is done entirely with HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).
